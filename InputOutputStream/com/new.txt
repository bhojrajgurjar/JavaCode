Again I love my country Hello, my name is Bhojraj Gurjar, and I come from Barwaha, near the Omkareshwar Jyotirling situated at the banks of the Narmada River. I completed my schooling in Barwaha and later pursued my Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA) at Chameli Devi Institute of Professional Studies in Indore.

In terms of my strengths, I consider myself a composed individual. Regardless of the challenges that come my way, I always try to maintain a calm behaivour. This quality not only enhances my problem-solving skills in daily life but also contributes to my professional approach. Additionally, honest is my strength that got most apreciation from peoples.

On the flip side, one area I'm working on is expressing my thoughts and feelings more openly. I sometimes tend to keep my emotions or opinions to myself.

When it comes to technical skills, I possess a solid understanding of programming languages such as Java, scripting languages like JavaScript, styling languages including CSS, structural language HTML, and SQL for database management. I am also familiar with tools such as MySQL, Netlify,Github, and Bootstrap.

In terms of my family background, I come from a decent and respected family.My family really value being spiritual. We own ancestral land used for farming, and my father actively engages in agriculture. .

Moving beyond academics, playing cricket has been a passion of mine since childhood. Additionally, visiting temples and holy places brings me immense peace. Lastly, I find joy in assisting my father with farming, connecting me to our ancestral roots.

I am eager to bring my technic
al skills and positive approach to contribute effectively to your team. Thank you for giving me opportunity to introduce myself"
